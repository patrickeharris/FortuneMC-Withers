# fortunemc-withers
A little plugin I made for the factions server FortuneMC to nerf withers so that they would better fit with the factions climate.
Changes the following for withers on FortuneMC:

1. Withers will spawn with 50% of their normal, vanilla max health.
2. Withers will not naturally regenerate health.

The plugin also includes a customizable, modular, hot-swappable system which allows any of the above changes to be enabled or disabled from in-game with commands.
